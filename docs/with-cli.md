# Command Line Interface (CLI)

You will find the CLI for each release in its assets in the [releases](https://github.com/4sh/datamaintain/releases). 
To launch Datamaintain using the CLI, you just have to execute the bash script you will find in the archive. 
To give values to [the settings](./cli-configuration.md), you just have to add ```--setting $SETTING_VALUE``` after ```./datamaintain-cli```.
