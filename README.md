# Datamaintain
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/4sh/datamaintain.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/4sh/datamaintain) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/4sh/datamaintain)

Datamaintain is a Kotlin library to maintain consistency between data and code : it runs your scripts in your database and tracks the scripts runned. 

According to your needs you may :
- [Use it as a dependancy in your Java or Kotlin server](asdependancy.md) : really handy to collaborate,
- [And/or use the Command Line Interface (CLI)](withcli.md) : enables more control when deploying.

For the moment Datamaintains supports only the DBMS MongoDB, but other configurations will soon be added (JDBC very soon)! We have created a documentation for creating new drivers : ["how to write a driver for your DBMS"](withcli.md). If you want to contribute, it is quite easy (no need to deeply know Datamaintain) and it would help a lot üôè.

## Benefits
During a project lifetime, you will often have to run scripts to update your database scheme or even add some data in it. The hard part comes when you have to ensure that all your scripts were executed and in the right order, which is exactly what Datamaintain is for! 

- **Transparent**, thanks to the script execution reports.
- **Light**, with few dependencies.
- **Customizable**, it is possible to run the scripts in different manners : with the server or independantly, ordered with tags, with your own program...
- **Idiot-proof**, Datamaintain has an identification based on the content that enables to manage homonyms scripts. You will never get angry with your colleagues again. We also have unit tests for the Datamaintain contributors. 
- **Evolutive and open-source**, the architecture does not matter to the DBMS so that we can easily create new DBMS drivers and finally have a common framework between all our projects.  We are a team of developers that come mainly from the [4SH agency](https://www.4sh.fr/), where Datamaintain is  used in several big projects. We works regularly on it according to the feedbacks of the users (our colleagues). We would be really happy to work with other people. If you are interested in this project don't hesitate to contact us.

## What is the best configuration for me ?

**üëå I want the simplest :** 

[Use it as a dependancy](asdependancy.md). The scripts are launched automatiquelly when the server starts. This is simple and really handy to collaborate. 

**üëæ I want personalisation :** 
- [Used as a dependancy](asdependancy.md) : You can program it with Java.
- [Used with the Command line interface (CLI)](withcli.md): You can master the order of my scripts and launch them independantly to the server thanks to executable file. I can also use Datamaintain in a project with already executed scripts. 

**Can I use both as a dependancy and with the Command Line Interface?**

Yes ! And that is often the case. You can develop your project with Datamaintain as a dependancy and then deploy in production with the Command Line Interface (CLI). 


## Quick links
### Getting started
**1) Discover :** [Read the benefits of Datamaintain](README.md#Benefits), [Chose your configuration](README.md#What-is-the-best-configuration-for-me-?), [read script reports], [use tags],

**2) Install :** depending on your choice, either [as a dependacy](asdependancy.md) and/or [with the Command Line Interface](withcli.md). If needed : [installation in a a project with alrady executed scripts](already-executed-scripts.md)

## Executed scripts in your database
Your scripts executions will be stored in your database. In Mongo, you will have a collection named ```executedScripts``` that will contain executed scripts, as defined below:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| id | | 
| name | | 
| checksum | | 
| identifier | | 
| executionStatus | | 
| executionDurationInMillis | Duration of your script execution, in milliseconds. | 
| executionOutput | |
